# ‚ö†Ô∏è sadly, this project is depricated

This repo relies on Stripe's data model to contain both a "product" and "order" object, both of which have been deprecated in favor of "price."

It would require a substantial rewrite to get this project running again ‚Äî¬†contributions are welcome, but unfortunately I don't see myself having time to do it in the near future.
